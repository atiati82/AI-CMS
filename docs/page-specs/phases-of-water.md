## Page Structure

### Hero Section

**Headline**: Phases of Water
**Subheadline**: Solid, Liquid, Gas — and the "Beyond" Layer That Explains Interfaces

**Introduction**:
Most people learn water as three phases: solid (ice), liquid (water), gas (vapor).

In water science and structured-water discussions, a fourth concept appears often: **interfacial/structured water** — not as a "new element," but as a layer of behavior near surfaces.

**Framework Promise**:
1. The classic phases
2. How phase change affects measurement  
3. The "interface layer" that bridges into EZ and structured models
4. How to test responsibly

---

### Step 1: One-Sentence Definition

> Water expresses different phases depending on energy and environment: solid, liquid, gas—and also distinct interfacial behaviors near surfaces that are often discussed as "structured" or EZ layers.

---

### Step 2: The Classic Three Phases

#### Phase 1: Solid (Ice)

Ice is water in a rigid lattice:
- Molecules are more fixed in position
- Structure becomes obvious (crystals, symmetry)
- Density behavior is unusual (ice floats)

**Bridge Link**: `/hexagonal-water-structures` (symmetry lens)

---

#### Phase 2: Liquid (Bulk Water)

Liquid water:
- Flows
- Forms temporary networks (hydrogen bonding changes rapidly)
- Responds strongly to temperature, gases, and dissolved ions

**Measurement Stack**:
- EC/TDS
- ORP
- pH
- Turbidity

**Bridge Links**:
- `/conductivity-tds-water`
- `/orp-redox-water`
- `/ph-balance-water`
- `/turbidity-clarity`

---

#### Phase 3: Gas (Vapor)

Water vapor:
- Reflects high energy state
- Changes concentration dynamics (evaporation concentrates dissolved solids)
- Shifts dissolved gas equilibrium in remaining liquid

**Why This Matters**:
- Evaporation changes TDS/EC
- Open containers drift over time

**Bridge Link**: `/natural-vs-treated-water` (source + gas behavior differences)

---

### Step 3: The "Beyond" Layer — Interfacial / Structured Water

#### What "Beyond" Means

It does **not** mean water becomes a new substance.
It means: **water near surfaces can behave differently than bulk water**.

Near interfaces, water can show:
- Ordering (hydration layers)
- Altered solute/particle behavior (exclusion-style effects in some setups)
- Time-based stabilization patterns

**Why structured water discussions focus on**:
- Surfaces
- Containers
- Minerals
- Flow
- Light
- Time

**Bridge Links**:
- `/hydration-layers-interfaces`
- `/structured-water-basics`
- `/ez-water-overview`

---

### Step 4: Why Phases Matter for Measurement

#### Temperature is the Master Variable

Temperature affects:
- Gas solubility (oxygen/CO₂)
- Meter readings stability
- Reaction rates and redox environments
- Evaporation/concentration

**Rule**: Whenever you compare water, log temperature.

**Bridge Link**: `/light-and-water` (light ↔ heat ↔ gases ↔ readings)

---

### Step 5: The 4-Parameter Fingerprint Across Phases

Water changes across phases or conditions; your fingerprint helps you track it:

1. **EC/TDS** → `/conductivity-tds-water`
2. **ORP** → `/orp-redox-water`
3. **pH** → `/ph-balance-water`
4. **Turbidity** → `/turbidity-clarity`

**Plus always log**: temperature + container type + time points

**Protocol Link**: `/parameter-tracking`

---

### Step 6: Phase-Related Observations

#### Ice / Melt Water Effects (Common Pattern)

When water freezes and melts:
- Dissolved gases can shift
- Minerals can concentrate in remaining unfrozen pockets
- Clarity patterns may change

*(No promises—just observable system behavior.)*

#### Rested Water vs Fresh Water

Even without phase change:
- Gas exchange
- Interface stabilization
- Temperature equalization

...can shift readings across hours.

**Bridge Links**:
- `/andara-vs-baseline-water-protocol`
- `/parameter-tracking`

---

### Step 7: Experiments

#### Experiment A: Freeze/Thaw Fingerprint

**Goal**: Observe how freezing influences the water fingerprint.

**Setup**:
- Baseline water in identical containers
- Freeze one sample, leave one as control
- Thaw the frozen sample fully

**Measure**:
- Temperature
- EC/TDS, ORP, pH
- Turbidity

**Log**: 0 / 30 min / 2 h / 24 h after thaw

**Reference Pages**: `/home-water-test-kit` + `/parameter-tracking`

---

#### Experiment B: Open vs Closed Container Drift

**Goal**: Observe gas exchange and evaporation effects.

**Setup**:
- Two identical containers
- One open, one sealed
- Same environment, same time

**Measure**:
- EC/TDS (evaporation concentration)
- ORP/pH drift (gas equilibrium)

This experiment teaches why protocols matter.

## FAQ Section

### 1. What are the phases of water?
Solid (ice), liquid (water), gas (vapor), and additional interfacial behaviors near surfaces often discussed as structured/EZ layers.

### 2. Is "structured water" a separate phase?
It's best treated as interfacial behavior (hydration layers/ordering) rather than a standalone bulk phase claim.

### 3. Why do ORP/pH readings change after water sits?
Temperature and dissolved gas equilibrium shift over time, especially in open containers.

### 4. Does freezing change water measurements?
It can shift gases and concentration distribution. Test it with a freeze/thaw protocol.

### 5. What's the best next page?
- For the "beyond" layer: `/hydration-layers-interfaces`
- For experiments: `/experiments-index`
