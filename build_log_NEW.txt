(!) /Users/atti/Documents/localhost-AI-CMS/andara-ionic-cms/andara-ionic-cms/client/src/components/diagrams/HexagonalGridDiagram.tsx is dynamically imported by /Users/atti/Documents/localhost-AI-CMS/andara-ionic-cms/andara-ionic-cms/client/src/components/component-resolver.tsx but also statically imported by /Users/atti/Documents/localhost-AI-CMS/andara-ionic-cms/andara-ionic-cms/client/src/components/diagrams/index.ts, dynamic import will not move module into another chunk.

(!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
- Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
- Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
- Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.
